A terminal file explorer.
Or for the romantics, a _typed_ file explorer.

The goal here is to have a self contained "real world" Haskell app that
people interested in the language can study and understand easily.

The application architecture is extremely simple on purpose, showing
that you can get pretty far without using crazy transfomer stacks or
fancy types. Everything you see here should be fairly straightforward
and can be scaled to larger applications with little effort.
