# Tex
A terminal file explorer.
Or for the romantics, a _typed_ file explorer.

The goal here is to have a self contained "real world" app that people
interested in the language can study and understand easily. Even though
the application architecture is fairly simple, it's what I would use in
large scale Haskell projects as well.
